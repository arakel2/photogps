GUI for ExifTool for easy geotagging of photos

Get exiftool: https://exiftool.org/

Place PhotoGPS in the same folder as ExifTool.



This tool, written in Autoit, offers a quick and easy solution for manipulating geodata from photos.
With Google Maps (unfortunately not OpenStreetMap), you can easily and quickly copy the coordinates of a location to the clipboard. To do so, right-click on the map; the coordinates will be displayed at the top. Left-clicking on them copies them to the clipboard.

Use the Paste button to import these coordinates into PhotoGPS. 

Next, simply add images using drag and drop. 

The data can then be imported into the images using the "Write GPS Data" button.
